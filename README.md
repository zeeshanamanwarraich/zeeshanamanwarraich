            <h3>Welcome to my Site</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Zeeshan Aman Warraich. I am a student at Lahore University of 
                Management and Sciences. I had my A levels from Beaconhouse School System.
                I am really passionate about learning new skills including programming and web
                designing. Below is me on a trip with my friends.

            <p>This page is about who I am, my skills and certifications. Apart from professional
                attributes it also includes my life memories. I have not been to any
                foreign countries, yet I am keen to go around world and have visited quite
                some places in my country. From the very beginning, I was a student of a local School
                and as time went on I got into a better school by 5th grade. With alot of struggle and 
                help of friends and family was able to bag quite some good grades. And then got into a good school and finally Lums.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="School">
            <h3>School</h3>
            <p>My early schooling is from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Elysium-Hall-High-School-Sargodha-1644034585857312/">Elysium Hall</a> that is a primary school. I studied there till 5th grade. And not to brag but was 
                high achiever that by 5th grade was awarded scholarship for the rest of time I would be there. 
                My father was really keen to provide his children with good education. On the suggestion of a 
                family friend he got me enrolled into another school "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/cgsspk/">Connoiseur Grammar School</a>". 
                For the time it was a great school. It was amongst the few school teaching O'levels. To Be honest, Till my first exams
                I had no idea how O'levels worked. And it was for my Maths and Physics instructor that we got
                some sort of idea about it. Finally exams came and Was able to score Straight A's with 6 of them as Asterisks. 
            </p>
            
        </div>
        <div id="Deciding College">
            <p>
                <h3>Deciding College</h3>
                Then it was the time to decide for College. I had already made up my mind to 
                go for A'levels but in an instituion offering wide variety of Courses. As in my city Less then 6 coursers
                were being taught at the moment. At the same time most of the schools had less than two years of experience.
                That meant I had to go for some school outside of my city, in cities like Lahore and Islamabad.
                My father was ready to get me enrolled in college of choice since I had highest grades at the time in my city. 
                We got scholarships from all the famous schools in central Punjab and Islamabad with schools like Lahore Grammar School, Roots and Beacon House. 
                However due to unavailability of accomodation had to return to my homecity and got enrolled in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CollegeCampusSargodha/">Beaconhouse College Campus Sargodha</a>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="College">
            <p>
                <h3>College </h3>
                Then the College Started. It was a great College with some great Instructors. One of them Especailly
                My math Instructor is one of the best Teacher I ever had In my Life. He was not just an instructor, But a mentor 
                and a great Guide. Two years went away with a blink of an eye though lot happened. Some 
                great events and some bad happenings. Finally I was able to Pass my A levels Exam with Straight A asterisks. The struggle 
                to decide University begin.

            </p>

        </div>
        <div id="University Decision">
            <h3>University Decision</h3>
            <p>
                This one was difficult. I had interest in Engineering as well as in Medicine. And from the 
                beginning wasnt able to decide as to what to choose. Then came the third choice: Accounting and Finance. 
                With applications sent and entry tests taken was able to secure position in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nust.edu.pk">NUST</a> and at the same time got offer from <a target="_blank" href="https://lums.edu.pk">LUMS</a> as well.
                By this I had my thinking changed. I wanted to pursue something different and let go off
                Maths, Chemistry, Physics and Biology. And I finally decided to go for LUMS. But somewhere in my heart I was longing to go for medicine.
                But unfortunately because of the conditions of Karachi I couldnt apply for <a target="_blank" href="https://aku.edu">AGHA Khan Medical College</a>. So LUMS it was.
